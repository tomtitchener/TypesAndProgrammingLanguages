 Examples from "Types and Programming Languages" Benjamin Pierce.
 1) Untyped lambda calculus with beta reduction "up to renaming of bound variables"
 2) Untyped lambda calculus with de Bruijn presentation and full beta reduction

 TBD:

   * testing/validation
     - add parse of comments and empty lines for file of definitions and lambda expressions
     - consume a file of definitions (maybe just a a list of text strings with a definition per line)
     - validate a series of lambda expressions and expected results
     - convert single file of lamba definitions and expressions into files that validate e.g. pairs, bools, numerals, recursion, etc.
